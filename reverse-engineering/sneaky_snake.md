# Sneaky Snake (30)

Find the flag in this encryted python script.
(decryptMe.py)



I downloaded the python script, and then opened it in VS Code. I changed the exec at the bottom to a print, so instead of evaluating the code it returned it to me. I saw a conditional where if you enter the password 'youfoundit', it will return the flag.

## Flag
```
CTFWU{y0u_f0und_1t}
```
