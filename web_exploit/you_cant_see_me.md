# You Can't See Me (20)

Can you find the hidden flag?

[You_Cant_See_Me.zip](ChallengeFiles/You_Cant_See_Me.zip)




I downloaded the files, and instead of deploying the website with nginx I navigated to the 'html_files' directory. I then opened dashboard.html with google where the flag is in plain text.

## Flag
```
flag: 1ns3cur3-J4va-15-B4d
```
