# I am The Doctor. Simply The Doctor. The one, the only, and the best. (30)
## Steps
1. We downloaded the image and used google's reverse image search to find out that it was a phrase in the fictional language "Gallifreyan" from the show Doctor Who. This was confirmed by the question title.
2. We used a [Gallifreyan](https://gallifreyan.info/guide/scg) guide to translate to english.
   - To check our work along the way, we used a [Translator](https://adrian17.github.io/Gallifreyan/) and compared the result to the original image.
