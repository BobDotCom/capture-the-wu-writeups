# I am The Doctor. Simply The Doctor. The one, the only, and the best. (30)
I downloaded the image and used google's reverse image search to find out that it was a phrase in the fictional language "Gallifreyan" from the show Doctor Who. Three of us then found a guide to Gallifreyan online and manually translated it, giving us the flag.

We manually translated it by first figuring out the basics of the language, such as vowels vs. consonants and that it is read counter-clockwise, then slowly translated each letter, checking our work using an online generator to check our work as we went. 

We also used educated guesses for what the next word could be. For example, the first word circle was short, and so we just translated "the" as a guess, and it matched the first word circle. We then would solve the first few parts of each word using the guide, then guessing the rest of the word, we eventually had the phrase: "the brighter my light" which we googled and found the phrase "the brigher my light, the stronger your shadow" we then translated that and found that it matched what was given.
