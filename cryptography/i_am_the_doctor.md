# I am The Doctor. Simply The Doctor. The one, the only, and the best. (30)
I downloaded the image and used google's reverse image search to find out that it was a phrase in the fictional language "Gallifreyan" from the show Doctor Who. Three of us then found a guide to Gallifreyan online and manually translated it, giving us the flag.

We manually translated it by first figuring out the basics of the language, such as vowels vs. consonants and that it is read counter-clockwise, then slowly translated each letter, checking our work using an online generator to check our work as we went.
