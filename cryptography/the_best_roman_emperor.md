# The Best Roman Emperor (10)

## Description
Someone delivered us an envelope with a hidden message, can you decipher it?

Uryyb Qnexarff, Zl Byq Sevraq


The encoded text, "Uryyb Qnexarff, Zl Byq Sevraq" looked like a Caesar Cipher. This was confirmed by the name of the
question, which mentions a Roman emperor. I ran it through different Caesar shifts until I found the correct one.
