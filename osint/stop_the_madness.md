STOP THE MADNESS
20
You get a note from your boss that a large group of cyber terrorists are holding an in person meeting somewhere in the United States. The only information you have received from your boss is 249857 and the terrorists could use this place to incite mass panic and considerable destruction of civilization.

Attempted solutions:

Found that 249857 is the code for a shade of paint called London Grey. Attempted to find the connection between this and a location where mass panic could be incited, but ultimately failed. We also know that it is a war of the worlds reference, but we couldn't find any locations from the movies or books that were correct.
