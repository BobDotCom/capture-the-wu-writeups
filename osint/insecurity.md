INSECURITY

๏ςรק and ᚲᚱᛚ say I’m kinda revoked. My name is ϩӠ९ϩ𝟠⊘५⊘7⊘ and I am now worthless.

Attempted solution:

Supposed that it could be a substitution cipher with unique characters. Assigned each character a letter and ran through dCode but yielded nothing.

Googled and found certain fonts, but they didnt lead anywhere.
