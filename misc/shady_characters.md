After some google searches for well known cyberattacks on the aerospace sector, I found a hacking group known as APT33, matching with the first part of the challenge description. They are also known as Elfin, similar to Elf, which matches with another hint from the challenge description. I found out that APT33 is a Iranian government backed group. Using Elfin and Iran, we know all parts to the flag.
