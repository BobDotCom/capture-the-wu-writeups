# NOT WHAT YOU THINK (10)

## Desc
 I invented the MAC so please address me with honor. Who am I?
 

The challenge asks for the creator of the MAC, but the name of the challenge makes me think it is actually the creator of the MAC address, as opposed to the much more well known Macintosh. The challenge also says to "address me with honor", further backing this theory. The creators of the MAC address were Xerox Parc, or Xerox.
